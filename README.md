# Password-Generator
Password generated with special characters

## Our Project 
Our client would like us to build them a random password generator.  We have been given requirements from the client on length and characters they would like to use.   


-what does application need to run?
password lower/uppercase, special characters, numbers.

List for all needed numbers 0-9.
List for all lower case a-z
List for all Uppercase A-Z
List all special characters !-*

# User input 
for each of the following, declare a variable to store the value:

password length verify that it is between 8-128
want lower/upper
case letters? 
numbers? 
special characters?

# What steps are needed to build a password 
-asking the user for criteria

- Make a list that only has the type of characters we are looking for (array list) matching the requested options

- Randomly select a character from the list 

- Then add the randomly selected character to the string "Password"

- Loop - repeat until password reaches the requested length.  

## What I learned from this project 

    -Take small steps. Run one line of code after you write it. 
    -JavaScript can smell fear.
