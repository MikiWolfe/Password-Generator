# Password-Generator
Password generated with special characters, numbers and letters.  

## Our Project 
Our client would like us to build them a random password generator.  We have been given requirements from the client on length and characters they would like to use. We are then printing that password to the text box on the HTML page.  We are using user input to make a password using their input to meet their requirements. 


# What I learned from this project 

    - Take small steps. Run one line of code after you write it. 
    - JavaScript can smell fear. 
    - Chrome console is a best friend.
    - How to make an alert, confirm and prompt to get user input and store it to be compared later.  
    - How to make an empty array to story and push strings into it.
